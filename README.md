## Hi there, I'm an Electrical Engineering Student, and this is me trying to codeðŸ‘‹
I love learning more about circuits and computers, but not so much coding. I like C/C++ and that is about as low and as high as I want to go as a programming language. My hobbies include learning about and modding older game consoles, and trying to fix them like Nintendo handhelds and any electronics that I don't want going to the landfill quite yet. I also love music and my iPod, and they go great together.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a better dad joke
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to lick batteries
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about hotwheels
- âš¡ Fun fact: I think 5V tastes better than 3.3V
